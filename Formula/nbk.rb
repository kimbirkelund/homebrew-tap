# Homebrew formula for nbk (stable channel).
#
# Source of truth. The Release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) rewrites
# `version` + `sha256` from the published release and copies this file into the
# tap repo at kimbirkelund/homebrew-tap:Formula/nbk.rb on every final release.
# The `url` interpolates `#{version}` against the `release/v<version>` tag and the
# universal tarball name produced by `build.ps1 -DoPackage`, so it needs no bump.
#
# Install:  brew install kimbirkelund/tap/nbk

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      nbk drives the macOS Notification Center through the Accessibility API, so the
      process that runs it (your terminal, or skhd) must be granted Accessibility
      permission:

        System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

      Check status any time with:  nbk doctor
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/nbk --version")
  end
end
